# Toy App

This project represents a step by step walkthrough of the second chapter of the [Rails Tutorial Book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/frontmatter) by Michael Hartl. The following are my solutions to the exercises, included in the same chapter.

## Answers

### Exercise set 1

1. Determine the CSS id for the text “User was successfully created.” What happens when you refresh your browser?

    - The id is `notice`. On refreshing the page, the `#notice` element has no content, though the element remains a part of the page.

2. What happens if you try to create a user with a name but no email address?

    - The user is successfully created.

3. What happens if you try create a user with an invalid email address, like “@example.com”?

    - The user is successfully created.

4. Destroy each of the users created in the previous exercises. Does Rails display a message by default when a user is destroyed?

    - Message displayed is _User was successfully destroyed._

### Exercise set 2

1. Write out the steps for visiting the URL _/users/1/edit_.

    - On making the request _/users/1/edit_, the cooresponding _controller#action_ pair, according to the `rails routes` listing, is the `edit` method of the _users_ controller. Also, according to the URL template, the `id` of the user being edited is _1_.
    - First, however, the `before_action` method is called, which uses the `set_user` callback, to put the user's details, retreived using the user `:id`, into the `@user` instance variable. 
    - Since the `edit` method content is empty, the controller then renders a form using the view, `edit.html.erb`. The form is imported from the partial `_form.html.erb`. The existing user data is passed into the view, to pre-fill the form fields, using the `@user` variable.
    - The rendered HTML is sent by the controller to the client browser.

    **On form submission**

    - The new information is sent to the server using the HTTP PATCH method, using the URL format _/users/1_ which then calls the `update` method of the _users_ controller.
    - If the update was successful, then the `show` action is executed and the new user details are displayed using the _/users/1_ URL, along with the notice message _User was successfully updated._
    - If the update failed, the edit page is displayed again with error messages.

2. Find the line in the scaffolding code that retrieves the user from the database in the previous exercise.

    - This is line number 2, of the _users_controller.rb_: `before_action :set_user, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]`

3. What is the name of the view file for the user edit page?

    - It's `app/views/users/edit.html.erb`

### Exercise set 3

1. Create a new micropost, then use your browser’s HTML inspector to determine the CSS id for the text “Micropost was successfully created.” What happens when you refresh your browser?

    - The id of the text is again `notice`. This is a part of the _show post_ view. On refresh, the `#notice` tag text content is empty. So no text is displayed.

2. Try to create a micropost with empty content and no user id.

    - _Micropost was successfully created._ In the index page, there is a micropost with no content and no user id.

3. Try to create a micropost with over 140 characters of content

    - _Micropost was successfully created._

4. Destroy the microposts from the previous exercises.

    - _Micropost was successfully destroyed._ for each destroyed micropost.

### Exercise set 4

1. Try to create a micropost with the same long content used in a previous exercise. How has the behavior changed?

    - Recieved error notification: _Content is too long (maximum is 140 characters)_.

2. Use your browser’s HTML inspector to determine the CSS id of the error message produced by the previous exercise.

    - Errors are enumerated in an unordered list, which is inside a div with the id `error_explanation`.

### Exercise set 5

1. Edit the user show page to display the content of the user’s first micropost. Confirm by visiting /users/1 that it worked.

    - Move the code from the view used to display all microposts to a partial, `_list.html.erb`, in order to be able to reuse the listing code. Render all microposts in the original _index_ view, using this partial.
    - In the _users_ controller, modify the `show` action to set the `@microposts` instance variable to all posts corresponding to the user being shown.
    - In the _users_'s _show_ view, list the user's microposts by referring to the `users/list` partial, and passing to it, the `@microposts` instance variable, that was set in the `show` action

2. Add a validation for the presence of micropost content in order to ensure that microposts can’t be blank. Verify that you get the desired behavior.

    - Add `presence: true` key-value pair to the arguments passed to `validates` method invoked in _micropost.rb_ model.
    - Error "Content can't be blank" shown for creating empty micropost

3. Validate the presence of name and email attributes in the User model.

    - invoke `validates` method for each _attribute symbol_ using the key-value pair, `presence: true`.

### Exercise set 6

1. By examining the contents of the Application controller file, find the line that causes `ApplicationController` to inherit from `ActionController::Base`.

    - This would be the line declaring the beginning of the `ApplicationController` class: `class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base`. This class is defined in the <em>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</em> file 

2. Is there an analogous file containing a line where `ApplicationRecord` inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base`?

    - That would be the <em>app/models/application_record.rb</em> file where the `ApplicationRecord` class is defined.

### Extra

1. Deploy app to heroku after committing all changes, using

        git push heroku
        heroku run rails db:migrate
        heroku open

2. Play around with the production toy app, and check if validation works.
